Benford's Law 
=============

Benford's law, (Benford's law) describes frequency distribution of the initial digit of numbers in data sets.<br/>
In a natural series of digits, the starting digit is more likely to be a lower digit.<br/>
So 1 is more common than 2, 2 is more common than 3, etc.<br/><br/>

This formula as determined in 1938 by Frank Albert Benford describes this distribution: 

$$P(d) = log_{10} (1 + \frac{1}{d})$$
